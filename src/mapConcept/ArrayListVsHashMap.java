	/*
	 * ArrayList and HashMap are both data structures in Java, but they serve
	 * different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
	 * 
	 * Purpose:
	 * ArrayList: It is an ordered collection of elements that can be accessed using
	 * an index. It is essentially a resizable array. You use ArrayList when you
	 * need to maintain an ordered list of elements and frequently access elements
	 * by their index.
	 * HashMap: It is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
	 * It allows you to retrieve values based on their associated keys. You use
	 * HashMap when you want to associate each element with a unique key and need
	 * efficient key-based retrieval.
	 * 
	 * Performance: 
	 * ArrayList: Retrieving elements by index is fast (constant time
	 * O(1)), but searching for an element based on its value takes longer (linear
	 * time O(n) in the worst case).
	 * HashMap: Retrieving values by key is generally
	 * fast (close to constant time O(1) on average), making it more efficient than
	 * ArrayList for key-based operations.
	 * 
	 * Duplicates: 
	 * ArrayList: It allows duplicate elements, and you can have
	 * multiple instances of the same value in the list.
	 * HashMap: It does not allow
	 * duplicate keys. If you try to insert a key-value pair with an existing key,
	 * the new value will overwrite the existing one.
	 * 
	 * Ordering:
	 * ArrayList: Maintains the order of elements based on their insertion
	 * sequence.
	 * HashMap: Does not guarantee any specific order of key-value pairs.
	 * The order can change over time and is not related to the order of insertion.
	 * 
	 * Memory Usage:
	 * ArrayList: Generally consumes less memory compared to HashMap
	 * because it only stores elements in a contiguous block of memory.
	 * HashMap: Requires additional memory to store key-value pairs and their hash codes.
	 * 
	 * Use Cases: 
	 * ArrayList: Suitable for scenarios where you need an ordered
	 * collection of elements and frequently access elements by index.
	 * HashMap:
	 * Ideal for situations where you need fast key-based retrieval and do not
	 * necessarily care about the order of elements.
	 * 
	 * In summary, choose ArrayList when you need an ordered collection and fast
	 * index-based access, and opt for HashMap when you require efficient key-based
	 * retrieval and the association of values with unique keys. Additionally, you
	 * might use them together in some scenarios where you need both ordered
	 * elements and key-based retrieval.
